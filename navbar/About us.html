                <h2 class="title1">The Owner</h2>
                <p>Marta Andersson started her own jewelry business in 2012. In the beginning, it was a small store mostly for friends and family, but now people all over the world know about it. 
                    In the early days, she created jewelry that reminded her of her hometown and her upbringing there. 
                    Later, as she traveled around Europe and the USA, her jewelry was influenced by the different places she visited. 
                    Marta wants her jewelry to be both beautiful and not too expensive. She wants everyone to be able to afford them, and that's a big reason why her business has become so successful.</p>
